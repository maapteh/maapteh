### Maarten / Maapteh

In order to create the unimaginable through creativity, i have to understand where my clients come from and where they are headed. I believe that within any creative business idea or proposition there is the opportunity to inspire and confirm its potential. This is my perspective.

**frontend developer** passionated about making accessible ultra-fast UI's, loving `GraphQL` and `Typescript` but also experimenting with `Golang`.
